      <h3><a href="https://technoplus.org/une-association-de-sante-communautaire/">Informer ne nuit pas a la santÃ© !</a></h3>
      <p>Techno+ is a non-profit organization in France that aims to promote individual and collective strategies for reducing risks associated with partying and to foster the development of techno culture. The association was created in 1995 by techno enthusiasts who were also consumers of synthetic drugs. They realized that there was a lack of information about these drugs and their effects, which led them to share their knowledge with others in the techno community. Techno+ is active in various techno events and creates a space called "chill-out" where people can rest, get information, and receive support if they have a bad experience with drugs. The organization also provides information about drugs and their use through brochures and online resources.</p>
